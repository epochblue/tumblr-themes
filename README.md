Tumblr Themes
=============

These are the [tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) themes I designed early in Tumblr's life. They are most likely _very_ out of date with Tumblr's current feature set. They're all available for free, with loose licensing. All themes are installable more directly by visiting [http://tumblr.com/themes/by/cubicle17](http://tumblr.com/themes/by/cubicle17).

Support
-------

These themes are provided as-is and without support. It's likely I'll answer simple questions, but I will not offer or respond to requests for customizations to these themes.


License
---------

Feel free to use and modify, but please give credit to me somewhere (doesn't have to be visible; can be in a comment in the code).
